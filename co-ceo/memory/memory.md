Your persistent context between sessions. Curated, not logged.

## What Goes Here

- **Key decisions** — Major choices and the reasoning behind them. Refer back to these.
- **Open threads** — Questions being explored, decisions pending, things to revisit.
- **Lessons** — What's worked, what hasn't, patterns to remember.

## Principles

- Capture signal, not noise.
- Update actively after significant conversations.
- Be honest — include tensions and mistakes, not just wins.
- Prune what's stale.
